\section{Pseudorandom Generator - PRG}
\begin{definition}
A distribution is considered \textbf{pseudorandom} if no efficient computation can distinguish it from the true uniform distribution by a non-negligible advantage. Formally, a distribution ensemble $D = \{D_n\}_{n\in N}$ is pseudorandom if for any ppt adversary A, and any negligible parameter $\epsilon$:
\begin{equation}
|Prob_{x \leftarrow D} (A(x) = 1) - Prob_{x \leftarrow U} (A(x) = 1)| \leq \epsilon
\end{equation}
Where $U_n$ represent the uniform distribution ensemble.\\
The previous equation can also be written as $D \approx_c U$ which means that the distribution ensemble $D = \{D_n\}_{n\in N}$ is computationally indistinguishable from the uniform distribution ensemble $U = \{U_n\}_{n\in N}$.\\
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \textbf{pseudrandom generator} is a deterministic algorithm $G: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^m$ with the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item Efficiency: G is computable in ppt
\item Expansion: $m > n$
\item Pseudorandomness: the ensemble $\{G(U_n)\}_{n \in N} \approx_c \{U_m\}_{m \in N}$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Increasing the expansion factor}
Suppose we have a PRG $G_1$ such that $G_1: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^{n+1}$ (a generator with expansion factor of 1 Bit), then we can construct a PRG $G$ with arbitrary polynomial expansion factor.\\
The construction is as follows: we start with a truly uniform input of $n$ bits,$U_n$, that are used as seed to the first instance of $G_1$, which by assumption is PRG. Next the output of the first instance of $G_1$ is divided in two parts: the first $n$ bits are fed into the second instance of $G_1$ as seed, while the last bit becomes the first bit of the output. If we repeat the process $m$ times we obtain $m$ pseudorandom bits.\\
It can be shown (using the hybrid argument)that $G$ (the PRG with poly expansion factor constructed using $G_1$) is also PRG. The sketch of the proof follows.
\begin{proof}
Let's consider $m+1$ intermediate distributions $H_i: 0 \leq i \leq m$ where the first $i$ bits are chosen from the uniform distribution and the last $m-1$ bits are chosen from the output of $G$. By construction $H_0$ is the full output of $G$ while $H_m$ is the truly uniform distribution $U_m$. $H_i$ and $H_{i+1}$ will be different in only one bit.\\
We assume that $G$ is not PRG, that is there exist some adversary A that can distinguish between $G$ ($H_0$) and $U_m$ ($H_m$) with non negligible advantage $\epsilon$. That means that there must exists an $i$ such that $A$ can distinguish between $H_i$ and $H_{i+1}$. Then we can construct and adversary $A^{'}$ that uses $A$ to distinguish between $G_1$ and $U_n$ by at least $\epsilon \over m$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
There exist PRG iff there exist OWF
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
$PRG \rightarrow OWF$\\
Consider a generator $G: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^{2n}$.\\
We define the following one way function: $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$ as follows: $f(x,y) = G(x)$ with $|x| = |y|$.\\
Now we assume by contradiction that there exist and adversary A that can invert $f$, that is:
\begin{equation}
Prob[f(A(f(U_{2n}))) = f(U_{2n})] > \epsilon
\end{equation}
Then we can construct and adversary $D$ that can distinguish between $G(U_n)$ and $U_{2n}$.\\
D on input $y = f(x)$ output 1 if $f(A(y)) = y)$ else output 0.
By construction we have that $f(U_{2n}) = G(U_n)$, therefore:
\begin{equation}
Prob[D(G(U_n))= 1] = Prob[f(A(G(U_n)) = G(U_n)] > \epsilon
\end{equation} 
Also we know that at most $2^n$ values of the image of $f$ can be mapped to the pre-image, therefore $A$ can invert $f$ only on those values, that is:
\begin{equation}
P(D(U_{2n})= 1) = P[f(A(U_{2n})) = f(U_{2n})] \leq {1 \over 2^n}
\end{equation}

(3) - (4) gives us a contradiction wrt the definition of PRG.
\end{proof}

The other direction of the proof, $OWF \rightarrow PRG$, can be found at \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_generator_theorem} and it makes use of the definition of hardcore bit. 

\subsection{Construction of PRG}
We can construct PRG from OW Permutations and the use of hard codre bit:
\begin{equation}
G(x) = f(x), B(x)
\end{equation}
The proof that $G$ is PRG follows from the definition of hard core bit: $f(x),B(x) \approx_c f(x), b$ with $b \leftarrow_R \{0,1\}$
 

\section{Pseudorandom Permutation - PRP and pseudorandom function PRF}

A family of functions $P^{a,n}$ is pseudorandom function/permutation if for any ppt adversary A:
\begin{equation}
Prob_{k \in \{0,1\}^a}[A^{P_k}= 1] - Prob_{P \in P^n}[A^{P}= 1] < \epsilon
\end{equation} 
where $P^n$ is the family of function/permutations $P: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$ 

Basically we have two experiment: in the first one the adversary interacts with an oracle representing a specific $f_k$ from the family $F= \{f_k\}_{k \in \{0,1\}^n}$  giving $x$ and receiving $f_k(x)$ back. In the second experiment the adversary interacts with an oracle that choose a random function from the family.
The function/permutation is random if the adversary cannot distinguish between the two experiments.\\

There is also a stronger definition (SPRF/PRP) where the adversary has access to the oracle to compute the image $f_k$ and the oracle to compute the pre-image $f^{-1}_{k}$. This definition takes into account a stronger adversary that has also access to a decryption oracle.  A can generates smart cipher texts in order to learn whether or not a real cipher was generated from a random permutation or from a pseudo random permutation.\\

\textbf{How to distinguish a random permutation from something totally random? COLLISION   }

\begin{theorem}
if there exist OWF then there exist SPRP
\end{theorem}
It can be proven in stages:
\begin{enumerate}
\item OWF $\rightarrow$ PRG 
\item PRG $\rightarrow$ PRF
\item PRF $\rightarrow$ PRP
\item PRP $\rightarrow$ PRF
\end{enumerate}

Stage 2) is the\textbf{ GGM theorem}.
\begin{theorem}
If there exist PRG then there exist PRF
\end{theorem}
GGM show how to efficiently construct a PRF given a PRG using a binary tree. The proof that the result is a PRF is done by hybrid arguments.\\

Stage 3) (form PRF to PRP) is done using the \textbf{Feistel Transform}. We need three round of the Feistel Transform to obtain a PRP. The theorem that prove it is \textbf{Luby and Rackoff '88}
